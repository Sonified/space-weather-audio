# TODO

- Set up a function that can back-fill 24 hours of data for a given station (in the correct format)

- Implement an intelligent visual and auditory normalization such that extreme outliers won't cause the entire signal for a day to be very quiet

- Explore de-trending prior to audification

- Add y-axis ticks for the waveform

- Add x-axis ticks for tracking time on both spectrogram and waveform

- Implement the system for marking regions of interest

- Build the flow for participants arriving on the page

- Test the whole pipeline with the Qualtrics back end

## Completed

- ✅ Circular buffer for AudioWorklet (got it working, sticking with circular buffer)
- ✅ Y-axis ticks for spectrogram (frequency axis with Hz labels)
